                    <a href="https://gitlab.com/thebluegiant/webapp">Pickamove</a> was a SaaS created in order to reduce commute time between work and home for people.<br>
                    The workflow was as follows: The current tenant advertises the place; the prospective tenant applies for a visit promising a referral fee (held in escrow) if it works out.
                    The advantages would be higher flexibility with leaving notice periods, and, since the place gets advertised by the current tenant, a more fluid rental market in low vacancy situations.<br>
                    The app backend was written in C# under ASP.net Core framework, and the frontend in HTML5/CSS and vanilla javascript.<br>
                    Pickamove founding team has graduated from <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">YC startup school 2019</a>, a 10 week-long program that connects entrepreneurs worlwidely to brainstorm their ideas.

                    I was doing research from home on how to improve the commuting experience between work and home places using simulations.
                    These simulations were multi-agent records programmed in Python and C++ with PyBind11 library serving as an operability interface between the 2 languages.<br>
                    I also did a lot of reading on the philosophical question of human free will all under the scientific framework of reinforcement learning and planning in the ambitious but unrealistic attempt to model the agents as naturally as possible.

                    I worked on a Situational awareness system for the automotive industry. The prototype included several computer vision and machine learning algorithms for object/pedestrian detection and tracking tasks.

                    The prototype was performing realtime processing of 720p images on these platforms (reaching sometimes 20 fps). <br>
